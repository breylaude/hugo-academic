abstract: "Brain-computer interface (or BCI) is basically setting up a
  connection between the human brain and the computer device to control or to
  perform certain activity using brain signals. These brain signals are
  translated as an action for a device. The interface thus provides a one-to-one
  communication pathway between the brain and the target. BCI users may control
  this activity by concentrating on a specific mental task- Motor Imagery (MI)-
  signals recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) is the most convenient basis
  for designing brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). As MI based BCI provides high
  degree of freedom, it helps motor disabled people to communicate with the
  device by performing sequence of MI tasks. Therefore, the aims of this paper
  are: (1)to explore the capabilities of BCI systems, (2) to classify algorithms
  for EEG-based BCI systems; adaptive classifiers, tensor classifiers, and deep
  learning, as well as some miscellaneous techniques, and (3) to know the use of
  MatLab, Python along with toolboxes and libraries for developing BCI systems."
