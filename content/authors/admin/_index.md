Work focuses mostly on solving problems from a broad range of systems, with experience in the full software engineering / development lifecycle, from frontend to backend code, to developing CI/CD pipelines to increase release cycles and streamline software delivery, to supporting that software in production by managing bare metal Linux servers using Ansible and Docker as well as deploying applications to Kubernetes clusters. Also likes to find zero-days on various IoT devices and embedded systems, former competitive programmer, check out [competitive programming blog](https://14ud3.blogspot.com/)
