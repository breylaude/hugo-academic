I see so many StackOverflow questions where it is clear that the original poster does not know debuggers exist much less how to use one because they could solve their problem in 5 minutes by putting one break point somewhere and looking at the value of a variable.

I also see senior programmers giving advice to newbies to not be too reliant on debugger. I actually think its a bad advice. Telling people to not be over-reliant on debuggers to the ears of someone who does not know how to use a debugger sounds like advising that they never learn to use one.
